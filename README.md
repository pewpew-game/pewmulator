# pewmulator
And emulator for running PewPew games on desktop computers

To use it clone this repository, install the dependencies from the `requirements.txt` and work in the directory.
```
git clone https://github.com/pewpew-game/pew-pygame.git
cd pew-pygame
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Note: If you are using the Mojave version of OSX, you will probably need to install `pygame==2.0.0.dev1`.

Typically you want to start with a `code.py` that you can later copy to your hardware.

The keys of the PewPew can be emulated by the arrow keys and `x` and `z`.

The emulator does not support brightness.
